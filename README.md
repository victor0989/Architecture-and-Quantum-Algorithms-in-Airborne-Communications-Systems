Components
The power supply is the component that generates the current that is supplied to the laser. When working continuously, the sources must offer great stability in the current levels supplied. In the case of pulse sources, it is additionally necessary that they can supply short pulses, with fast turn-on times and offer low duty cycles.

The temperature stabilizer, this is a critical part of the experimental setup,
since it is what avoids the errors introduced by the variation of the ambient temperature. They are essential to guarantee the reproducibility of the results.

The guidance and selection of the beams, this stage is where the emitted light is collected
to be introduced into the measurement device, in this part of the process it is possible to filter the emission spectrum to eliminate unwanted emission modes and improve the measurements.

The detection of the spectra, in this final stage is where the spectra are obtained
ASE, for which an Optical Spectrum Analyzer is usually used.
